## Development Environment

For command development, please use Godot 4.1+

## Adding Commands

* Create a Signal (see tasking Node)
* Create a Node
* Attach the signal to the new Node
* Create a GDScript and attach it to the new Node

## Adding C2 Profiles

- Nope, just the zippy-websocket profile at this time - support for other profiles wouldn't be difficult - I just don't care :-P
